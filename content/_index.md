I'm an astrophysicist at [Monash University](https://monash.edu) in Melbourne, Australia.

I research stars. I want to know what they're made of, and how they change with time, and I use stars as tracers to better understand exoplanets and galaxies. Most of my work involves computational data analysis and open-source software. For this reason, I've been fortunate enough to contribute to research in a lot of different domains. 

I've taught university-level classes in physics, data analysis, machine learning, scientific computing, and many more.

I never intended to be an astronomer, but everyone makes mistakes.
