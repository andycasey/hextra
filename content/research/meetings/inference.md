title: Inference with data
---

The **Inference with data** meeting series is a place to discuss problems and progress in statistical inference and data analysis. That might include simple data analysis, rigorous statistical modelling, or machine learning. The series is open to anyone who is interested in these topics, and we welcome contributions from all participants.

### Objectives 

1. To facilitate a place to discuss problems and progress in statistical inference and data analysis.
2. To increase awareness of statistical methods used in different areas of physics and astronomy at Monash.
3. To improve cross-domain communication with the smallest possible glossary of domain-specific terms (i.e., cut the jargon).
