## Email

You can email me at [andrew.casey@monash.edu](mailto:andrew.casey@monash.edu). My office and mobile phone numbers are listed in my email signature. So if we have had some correspondence, you can probably find my phone numbers in your email inbox.

I usually don't respond to emails on weekends or outside of working hours. My normal working day starts early (between 4am and 6am is not uncommon) and ends when I have family commitments, or when I get tired. I try to achieve _Inbox Zero_ on fridays, but it doesn't always work.

## Schedule a meeting

You don't need to email me to schedule a meeting. Just send a Google Calendar invite to andrew.casey@monash.edu. That calendar is publicly available and is usually the best reflection of my availability. A view of that calendar is embedded below on this page.

A few things to note:

1. I schedule all my commitments in as few days as possible, with no breaks between meetings.

2. If I have 32 hours of meetings per week then having them scheduled in 3 days gives me 2 days of _uninterrupted research time_, which is critical to my productivity.

3. When selecting a mutually convenient time, try to select a time that is _immediately before_ or _after_ meetings already scheduled in my calendar. *This strongly increases the likelihood of me accepting the invitation!*

4. Don't worry about leaving me a 'lunch break'. Schedule the meeting back-to-back with other meetings. I will solve my caloric scheduling.

5. Don't default to an hour-long meeting unless you really think it's necessary. Think about how much time you actually need.

6. In Google Calendar, navigate to *Settings > Event settings* and set the _Default guest permissions_ to 'Modify event'. That means I can move the meeting time in both of our calendars. Without this I have to decline the event and create a new one with all your original notes and location information.

I follow these rules to maintain my own productivity and to ensure that you have my _full attention_ when you're meeting with me.
